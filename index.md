## Portfolio Analysis with APIs

#### Retirement Planning: 

When analyzing the data for Harold's retirment portfolio, the risk of the portfolio stands out first. If Harold would liek to assume less risk and see less volatility in his portfolio, I would recommend increasing his weight in the AGG postiion. If Harold does want to assume more risk in order for a chance at more returns, SPY would be the holding to increase. SPY has a much higher standard deviation of daily returns than AGG and increasing this holding gives Harold more earning potential, but not without appropriate risk.
